#Simple Slides
#####A quick slideshow tool I put together for a Barcamp Bournemouth 6 lightning talk.

###Usage
Usage is simple. Open up the index.html file and add the following to create a slide...

```HTML
	<div class="slide">
		<img src="" alt="A slide image">
	</div>
```

When you load the page, the first image in each slide will be selected and added to the slide element as a background image. 

###Controls

+ Press 'f' to make the slides go full screen.
+ Press 'esc' to exit fullscreen
+ Press the left and right arrow keys to progress through your slides
+ Or use the mouse to click through them.
